# Run-Tracker
First Solo Project - (15/12/2025 - 03/01/2026)

## How to Run

 - To run this program, you need to execute the app.py file, which will generate a display window that you can interact with. This allows you to view both your predicted and current times for the variety of distances you input.

 - The files — calculations.py, predictions.py, utils.py, and zones.py—contain the code responsible for performing the calculations. The results.py file receives the output from these files, displays the results to the user, and provides the option to save them to a text (txt) file.

## Images
This is the main output through the display:

This is an image of the text file that the user can save the output as:

## Next Steps

- My aim is to recreate this project in Java and explore ways to run the application on a mobile device.
